Hi, today I come to you with a quick tip on how to update your **StateFlows **safely in Kotlin.

Recently a new version of **Kotlin Coroutines **library was released with a few new extensions functions to help you with **StateFlow **updates. It all started with this issue:

Let‚Äôs see what it‚Äôs all about‚Ä¶

## First time using StateFlow?

If it‚Äôs your first time with **StateFlow **and you want to know more about it and how it relates to others like **SharedFlow **or **LiveData**, you can read my article about it here:

## Let‚Äôs begin

**StateFlow **is mostly used for handling state and state updates. It can be used for example in Android‚Äôs **ViewModel **to expose state to your views.

Let‚Äôs see an example:

How to collect this state now in **Fragment **for example? All info can be found in my article I mentioned before :)

### How can we update the state?

Well, it‚Äôs really easy, since we use a data class. We can just use **copy **like this:

    _uiState.value = _uiState.value.copy(title = "Something")
    

Simple, right? But you have to be careful‚Ä¶

## The issue

So what‚Äôs the problem? While the code is very simple, there is something you have to be aware of: **CONCURRENCY**.

If between the time **copy **function completes and the **StateFlow‚Äôs **new value is emitted another thread tries to update the **StateFlow‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää**by using **copy **and updating one of the properties that the current **copy **isn‚Äôt modifying ‚Äîwe could end up with results we were not expecting.

## Solution

How do we solve this problem? By using fresh good stuff from **Kotlin Coroutines **for **MutableStateFlow**.

The stuff I‚Äôm talking about are these three methods:

- [update](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/update.html)
- [updateAndGet](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/update-and-get.html)
- [getAndUpdate](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/get-and-update.html)

All of these take a function parameter that returns the new state that will be emitted.

Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs inside the [update](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/update.html) method for a moment:

    public inline fun <T> MutableStateFlow<T>.update(function: (T) -> T) {
        while (true) {
            val prevValue = value
            val nextValue = function(prevValue)
            if (compareAndSet(prevValue, nextValue)) {
                return
            }    
        }
    }
    

As we can see, a function is passed as a param and it‚Äôs applied to the current **StateFlow**‚Äôs value. Then **compareAndSet **function is used to determine if the value has changed‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfor example by another thread. If **compareAndSet **returns false then the while loop will be running until it‚Äôs possible to update the state.

So how to use it? Let‚Äôs see an example **SAFE **update now:

    _uiState.update { it.copy(title = "Something") }
    

That‚Äôs it! This ensures us that the state can be changed **safely**!

That‚Äôs all for this article. I hope you‚Äôll update your **StateFlow** safely now. Be sure to check out my other articles on the website!
